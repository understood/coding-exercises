# Dockerfile Review Exercise

In this exercise, you will be presented with a real-life problem we solved with our Dockerfile. We take containerization seriously and strive for best practices in our Dockerfiles to ensure efficient, secure, and maintainable container images. This exercise assesses your ability to troubleshoot and optimize an existing Dockerfile. Your task is to analyze the Dockerfile and identify any issues, inefficiencies, or best practices that are not being followed.

## Task Description

Your task is to:

1. Clone the repository containing the provided Dockerfile.
2. Examine the Dockerfile.
3. Identify any issues or areas where best practices are not followed.
4. Submit an improved Dockerfile with annotations to explain your changes. 

## Assumptions
- The container runs a Next.js service.
- The directory containing the Dcokerfile includes many files that are not needed for building or running the service.
- This Dockerfile is built in three environments:
  - local
  - ephemeral (short-lived, encapsulated branch deployment. gets rebuilt after every commit)
  - production.
- We use any generic CI/CD providers that support containerization. 

## Submission

Submit an improved Dockerfile with annotations to explain your changes.

## Evaluation

Your review will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Identification of issues and inefficiencies in the Dockerfile.
- Clarity and thoroughness of your suggestions for improvement.
- Adherence to Docker best practices.
- Attention to security and performance considerations.

## Additional Information

If you have any questions or need clarification about the exercise, please don't hesitate to contact the recruiter.
